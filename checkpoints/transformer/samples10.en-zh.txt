in fact , the current dynamic that you see between iran and israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the cold war than in the events of 1979 , because at this point , iran and israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region , and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners , they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors .	事實上 , 伊朗和以色列之間的動態 , 在地質改革之後 , 比1979年冷戰事件發生的數位化反應 , 比伊朗和以色列帝國的兩種更強大的區域 , 而不是每個地方都更安全 。
but what i'm saying is , you can be delighted , because the editor of science , who is no dummy , and both of these fairly professional really professional teams , have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom lines in their papers they have to say , what this means is , that what we've been thinking , was the global circulation model that we predict that the earth is going to get overheated that it's all wrong . it's wrong by a large factor .	但 , 我說的是 , 你可以很開心 , 因為科學的編輯 , 他沒有塵埃 , 而這兩位專業團隊都非常專業 , 真的是同類的結論 , 在他們的論中 , 他們必須說 , 這意味著 , 我們所想的 , 全球性循環是錯的 。

thank you . it's okay to applaud the laws of physics , but essentially what's happening here is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane , creating a visible waveform , and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency , and the height is showing us amplitude .	感謝 。 可以掌握物理的定律 , 但基本上 , 在這裡發生的事是從空氣和氣分子的能量 , 影響財富的貢獻 , 創造出一個可見的波動 , 我們能看見壓力的改變 , 而我們稱之為 「 壓力 」 , 的反應 , 我們稱之為 「 回收 」 。
dr: well the truth of the matter is , postseptember 11th , i felt myself in the role originally first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .	博士:事實是 , 十一月11日 , 我覺得自己是屬於所有住在部落和鄰居的人 , 都被摧毀了 , 身為一英里的人 , 在那裡工作的人 , 我覺得自己和我一起工作的角色是同一百人 , 一直在創作我們所創造的地方 。
and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something , what we're talking about is that , for the average lowincome kid , that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career , just doing the preschool , not improving k12 or anything else after that , not doing anything with college tuition or access , just directly improving preschool , and we would get five percent higher earnings for middleclass kids .	如果我們想翻譯一下 , 從數十億美元到有意義的東西 , 我們正在談的是 , 對低收入的孩子而言 , 這將會增加百分之十二的薪水 , 只要在職涯中 , 才會增加百分之五的薪水 , 只能改善12或其他的學科 , 或是直接改善任何事 , 我們會得到更高的中產階的孩子 。

it's kind of clarifying , and that's just what you want for an enzyme in your laundry , because you want to be able to have an enzyme that can be a protein chowhound , just chew them up , because you're going to get different protein stains on your clothes , like chocolate milk or grass stains , for example , and something like this is going to help you get them off .	很明顯 , 這只是你在你的喉嚨裡想的酵素 , 因為你想讓酵素成為一個蛋白質的染色體 , 只是把它們弄起來 , 因為你會得到不同蛋白質的染色 , 像牛奶或草一樣 , 像這樣的例子 , 你會得到類似的蛋白質 。
and , working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverseengineer , i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find , took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that , inside this object , which i'd bought for just 3 . 49 pounds , there were 400 different bits made out of a hundredplus different materials .	工作的概念是最便宜的電池 , 也是最簡單的回收工程師 , 我去買了我能找到的最便宜的大樓 , 把它帶回家 , 帶回家 , 我買了這個東西 , 我買了349磅 。

this region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults , and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world , and they all show the same thing , that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence .	這區域比較積極 , 當青少年在做這些社會決策時 , 思考其他人比成年人還要活躍 , 而這其實是世界上有九個不同的研究 , 而他們都呈現了同樣的事 , 媒體前額葉皮質區域的活動 , 在青少年時期 , 媒體皮質下降 。
you have taken the dreams of that nineyearold boy , which were impossible and dauntingly scary , dauntingly terrifying , and put them into practice , and figured out a way to reprogram yourself , to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise .	你把那九歲男孩的夢想帶回去 , 很可怕 , 很可怕 , 很可怕 , 很可怕 , 把他們放進練習中 , 想出一個方法來複製你自己 , 來改變你的原始的恐懼 , 使你能夠回到其他地方的體驗 。

paul piff: and as the game went on , one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor , poor players , and more and more demonstrative of their material success , more likely to showcase how well they're doing .	保羅·皮特:當遊戲出現時 , 我們觀察到的其中一個非常有趣的和戲劇性的模式之一 , 就是富裕玩家開始變得越來越少 , 變得越來越不敏感 , 對於那些貧窮、貧窮、貧窮、玩家、玩家 , 更有吸引力的材料 , 更有可能他們如何運作 。
if a is the question , b is the answer , stay creative in the cloud , and you start going , and experiments don't work , experiments don't work , experiments don't work , experiments don't work , until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense , like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet .	如果一個問題是:b就是答案 , 保持創意 , 你開始做實驗 , 實驗不會運作 , 實驗不會運作 , 實驗不會運作 , 實驗不會運作 , 實驗不會運作 , 實驗不會有效 , 直到你和負面情緒聯繫 , 看起來就像你基本的假設一樣 。
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .	然而 , 在這個國家 , 在這個古南方國家 , 我們檢驗了你十一倍的人 , 如果受害者是白人 , 比受害者是黑人 , 22倍的可能性更有可能得到受害者 , 如果受害者是黑人和受害者在美國 , 受害者是有害者的 。
and so , just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off .	所以 , 剛剛從蘇格洛夫到大西洋 , 當我們推進猶太河流時 , 這個巨大的氣球在氣球的頂端 , 幾百英里 , 我們在底部的雕塑 , 可能是兩英里 , 直到兩英里 , 一英里外 , 氣球的頂部氣球 。
well , to my mind , rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention , we've paid attention to the biological evidence , we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence , and we've used science as a tool for translation , translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind .	嗯 , 對我來說 , 不是把科學當作是創新的工具 , 我們專注於生物證據 , 我們已經把重要性放到人類身上的證據 , 而我們使用科學作為一個工具 , 我們已經使用的工具 , 把科學當作一個工具 , 轉化為一個已經被使用的工具 。

and a lot of that learning , i think , came from being on that farm , because when i was working on the farm , we'd have to use what was around us , we'd have to use the environment , and there was no such thing as something can't be done , because you're in an environment where , if you can't do what you need to do , you can die , and , you know , i had seen that sort of thing happen .	我認為 , 很多這樣的學習 , 來自農場工作 , 因為當我在農場工作時 , 我們必須使用我們周遭的環境 , 我們必須使用環境 , 這樣做就沒辦法做 , 因為你在環境裡做不到 , 因為你在環境裡做不到 , 如果你不能做什麼 , 你看不見你該做的事 , 會發生什麼事 。
