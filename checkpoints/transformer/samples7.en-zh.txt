paul piff: and as the game went on , one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor , poor players , and more and more demonstrative of their material success , more likely to showcase how well they're doing .	保羅·史蒂夫:當遊戲出現時 , 我們觀察到的最有趣的、最戲劇的模式之一是 , 富裕的玩家開始變得越來越嚴重 , 越來越少 , 那些窮人 , 比那些窮人 , 較差 , 更糟 , 更糟的是 , 玩家們 , 更有趣 , 更令人興奮的是 , 他們的材料的材料 , 他們的表現得更有可能是多樣貌 。
